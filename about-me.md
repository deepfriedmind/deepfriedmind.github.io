My name is Andreas Wahlqvist and I hail from Stockholm, Sweden.

I :purple_heart: amazing design and beautiful code.

Here's a poem I wrote in Bash, just for you:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

POEM="Roses are \033[00;31mred\033[0m\nViolets are \033[00;34mblue\033[0m\nIf you grant me root then I shall sudo"

echo -e $POEM
{% endhighlight %}

That is all. Thank you.
